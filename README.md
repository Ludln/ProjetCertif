### Expected result ###
There is at least 15 major issues. They can be categorized in:

We expect you to identify:
 - the most critical vulnerabilities
 - at least 1 vulnerability per category
 
For each vulnerability you should document:
 - The problem location
 - The impact on the application
 - A proposition on how to fix it
 - How you've identified it

We also expect you explain what as been your approach in order to run this analysis.

Good luck !
